## Image pre-processing with Google and PyTorch ![img](Drive-Colab-PyTorch.jpg)

The goal of image pre-processing is to make improvements to the data by applying transformations such as [histogram equalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram_equalization).

It is considered the cleanup step ðŸ§¹ which prepares the input to have the same quality for the model.

This repository contains techniques using libraries like OpenCV and PyTorch.

In addition, it includes necessary commands to work in Google Colaboratory while uploading data from your Google Drive and saving the final images on your computer.
