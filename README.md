## Image pre-processing with Google and PyTorch  ![img](Drive-Colab-PyTorch.jpg)

The goal of image pre-processing is to make improvements to the data by applying transformations such as a histogram equalization 
for contrast adjustment by spreading the most frequent intensity values.

It is considered the cleanup step ðŸ§¹ which prepares the input to have the same quality for the learning model.

This repository contains some techniques using libraries like OpenCV and Pytorch.

In addition, it includes necessary commands to work in Google Colaboratory while uploading data from your Google Drive
and saving the final images on your computer.
