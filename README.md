## Image pre-processing with Google Colaboratory and PyTorch 

The goal of pre-processing is to make improvements to the data by applying transformations such as scaling or normalization.

It is considered the cleanup step ðŸ§¹ that helps preparing the data for input to the learning model.

This repository contains some image preprocessing techniques using libraries like OpenCv and Pytorch.

In addition, it includes some necessary commands to work in Google Colaboratory when taking data from your Google Drive
and saving the final images on your computer.
