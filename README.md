## Image pre-processing with Google and PyTorch  ![img](Drive-Colab-PyTorch.jpg)

The goal of image pre-processing is to make improvements to the data by applying transformations such as scaling or normalization.

It is considered the cleanup step ðŸ§¹ that prepares the images to be the right input to the learning model.

This repository contains some techniques using libraries like OpenCV and Pytorch.

In addition, it includes necessary commands to work in Google Colaboratory while uploading data from your Google Drive
and saving the final images on your computer.
