## Image pre-processing with Google and PyTorch ![img](Drive-Colab-PyTorch.jpg)

The goal of image pre-processing is to make improvements to the data by applying transformations such as [histogram equalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram_equalization).

It is considered the preliminary phase that improves the quality of the data for the model.

This repository contains techniques using libraries like OpenCV and PyTorch.

In addition, it includes necessary commands to work in Google Colaboratory while uploading data from your Google Drive and saving the results on your computer.

**P.S.**: This code was part of my thesis __Artificial visual perception of facial emotions__ to opt for the *MSc in IT and Cognition (UCPH)*. 
This research consisted in a computational  model  based on the theory cognitive empathy and visuomotor processing, approached with the combination of 
convolutional neural networks and variational autoencoder techniques.
